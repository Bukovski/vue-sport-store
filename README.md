The store has a shopping cart, `search` for records, selection of the number of records `per page`, page `pagination`. `Filtering data by categories` has been implemented. The order form is `validated` before shipment.
The `admin panel` displays all records, edits and adds new records. All orders on the site are also displayed in the admin panel.
Using `json-server` we emit server work. All data for the site is generated by the `faker.js` library in the `data.js file`. `authMiddleware.js file` monitors POST GET requests to the server, sends and verifies the `token`

## How to start app
At first start local server with data `npm run json-server` and then `npm run dev`
